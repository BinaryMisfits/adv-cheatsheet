# Program / Commands
(you can paste these into your lab file as the “program”)
    1. Install (if not already installed):
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nikto -y
# or run from source
# git clone https://github.com/sullo/nikto.git
# cd nikto
# perl nikto.pl -h
    2. Update plugins (nikto uses built-in plugin files; ensure package is recent):
# No single update command; update OS package or pull latest nikto from GitHub if needed.
    3. Basic scan (HTTP):
# scan http://localhost on default port and show results in terminal
nikto -h http://localhost
# scan specific port
nikto -h http://127.0.0.1:8080
    4. Save results to file (CSV, HTML, or plain text):
# save as text
nikto -h http://localhost -output nikto_scan.txt
# save as HTML
nikto -h http://localhost -Format htm -output nikto_scan.html
# save as CSV
nikto -h http://example.com -Format csv -output nikto_scan.csv
    5. More options (useful in lab):
# verbose, use SSL (https), follow redirects
nikto -h https://localhost -ssl -Tuning 123b -Display V -output nikto_https.html
Note: Running nikto against systems you don’t own or don’t have permission to test is illegal/unethical. Only scan your lab systems or systems you have explicit authorization to test.
Sample output 
Below is a representative, shortened nikto text output you can include in your record. (I’ve condensed it; your actual run will show full plugin messages.)
