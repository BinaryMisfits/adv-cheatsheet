To secure a Linux system by configuring a firewall (using ufw) to block all incoming and
outgoing traffic except SSH (Port 22) for remote administration.
Procedure
1. Check Current Firewall Status
Before making changes, verify if ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) is active.
2. Set Default Policies
Configure ufw to deny all incoming and outgoing traffic by default.
3. Allow SSH (Port 22)
Enable SSH to ensure remote access remains available.
4. Enable the Firewall
Activate the firewall to apply the rules.
5. Verify Firewall Rules
Check the applied rules to confirm only Port 22 is allowed.
6. Test Connectivity
Ensure SSH is accessible while other ports (e.g., HTTP - 80) are blocked.
Commands & Output
1. Check Firewall Status
bash
sudo ufw status
Policies (Deny All Traffic)
bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default deny outgoing
3. Allow SSH (Port 22)
bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
